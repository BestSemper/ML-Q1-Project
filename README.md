Emergency Medical Services, more commonly known as EMS, is a system that responds to emergencies in need of highly skilled pre-hospital clinicians. The EMS Computer Aided Dispatch System generates data about the incident as it relates to the assignment of resources and the Fire Departmentâ€™s response to the emergency.

We want to predict the disposition code (indicating the final outcome of the incident) of an EMS incident. This will help the medical industry at large and provide insight on what aspects of emergency response are most effective for delivering successful care to patients.
